            <br />
            <p>
              For me, drawing is a fun way to unwind and just take some time to
              think. I've likely spent coutless hours trying to improve my
              skills. I often get inspired after seeing other people's art.

            <p>
              I've always loved reading! To me, there's nothing better than
              plopping down on a couch and finishing a book in one sitting. I
              would list my favourite books, but to be honest, it's really
              impossible to choose just one.

            <p>
              Trying out new recipes is always really fun for me! I love adding
              my own twist or addition to existing recipes. My favourite recipe
              to make is cheesecake cookies!
